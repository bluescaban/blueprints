# BluePrints Specifications

## Overview

BluePrints produces structured documentation following a clear workflow:

**spec → plan → tasks → flows**

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Spec (Specification)
The specification phase captures:
- Business requirements
- Technical constraints
- User needs
- Success criteria

### 2. Plan
From the spec, we create a detailed plan that includes:
- Architecture decisions
- Technology choices
- Implementation strategy
- Timeline and milestones

### 3. Tasks
The plan is broken down into actionable tasks:
- Clear, discrete units of work
- Dependencies identified
- Assignment-ready items
- Testable outcomes

### 4. Flows
Finally, we generate visual flows:
- Mermaid user flow diagrams
- Process flowcharts
- State diagrams
- Machine-readable JSON outputs

## Integration with FigJam/Figma

BluePrints is designed to integrate with FigJam and Figma MCP workflows, enabling:
- Extraction of design concepts
- Conversion to structured specs
- Automatic flow generation
- Seamless handoff to development

## Future Enhancements

- UI dashboard for viewing flows and specs
- Real-time collaboration features
- AI-powered spec generation
- Version control for documentation
