# BRD (Business Requirements Document)

This directory contains extracted business requirement notes and documentation.

## Purpose

Store and organize business requirements gathered from stakeholders, FigJam sessions, and product planning meetings.

## Structure

Each BRD should include:
- Problem statement
- Target audience
- Success metrics
- Constraints and assumptions
- Acceptance criteria

Files will be added here as requirements are gathered and documented.
