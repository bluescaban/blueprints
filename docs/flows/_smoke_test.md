# Smoke Test - Simple Mermaid Diagram

This is a simple smoke test to verify that Mermaid diagrams can be embedded in Markdown files.

## Sample User Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Opens App] --> B{Is Authenticated?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Show Dashboard]
    B -->|No| D[Show Login]
    D --> E[User Enters Credentials]
    E --> F{Valid Credentials?}
    F -->|Yes| C
    F -->|No| D
    C --> G[User Navigates]
    G --> H[View Specs]
    G --> I[View Flows]
    G --> J[Generate Documentation]
```

## Description

This simple flow demonstrates:
- User authentication check
- Conditional routing based on auth state
- Basic navigation options once authenticated

This serves as a baseline example for more complex flows that will be generated by BluePrints.
